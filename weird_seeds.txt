#   Mad mouse walks next to the cheese, keeps running around the center of the maze.
#   I'm very curious for an explanation of what is going on here.
#   Also: I think (but I'm not super-sure) that vector field from procgen_tools is not
#   calculated correctly here - on the field next to the cheese it says "mouse will most likely go up",
#   while in rollout it usually goes left.

#   Mouse gets stuck somewhere, i.e. neither goes to the cheese
