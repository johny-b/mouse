CHANNEL 121

Obeservations: predefined environments in custom_channels.py and a few dozens
random 25x25 mazes.

Observations:
*	If UP is not a legal move, sum of the channel is always low (<2)
*	If channel has a high (~ > 8) sum, highest values always show mouse location
*	If channel has a high sum, mouse always goes UP
*	In all predefined examples, high sum happened when UP lead to cheese
*	In random examples, high sum sometimes happens when UP leads to top right
