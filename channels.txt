CHANNEL 121

Obeservations: predefined environments in custom_channels.py and a few dozens
random 25x25 mazes.

Observations:
*	If UP is not a legal move, sum of the channel is always low (<2)
*	If channel has a high (~ > 8) sum, highest values always show mouse location
*	If:
	* Channel has a high sum 
	* We are not in top right 5x5
	then mouse will go UP.
	(Note: I'm not sure how important is the second condition)
