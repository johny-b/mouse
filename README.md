# Mouse-in-the-maze experiments

## Installation

## Code

Scripts:

1. `browse_channels.py` - Compare sums of activations of a channel in a simple maze
2. `channel_sum.py` - Plot the relationship between channel sum and direction of the cheese in a set of random mazes
3. `high_channel_sum.py` - Analyze behaviour of the mouse when sum of a given channel is high
4. `ablated_channel_rollout.py` - Compare rollouts between original and modified policy
5. `find_channels.py` - A simple detector of important channels

Tools:
*   `tools.py` - Many different more-or-less general functions/classes. Messy.
*   `custom_mazes.py` - A set of simple predefined mazes. Messy.

Other:
*   `weird_seeds.txt` - Few seeds where mouse does a really weird thing.
